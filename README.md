## Hi there, I'm Jorge 👋

### About

I’m a mechatronics engineer by profession, a .NET developer by choice and a Data Science enthusiast in my free time.
In the intersection between web development and data science, I like to analyze datasets, find meaningful information
inside them, create a story and publish the results on my personal blog, together with other various articles.
